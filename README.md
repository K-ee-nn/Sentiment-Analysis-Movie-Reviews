## Introduction
In this project, I was tasked to build a Neural Network that was capable of predicting whether a movie review is of a positive sentiment or a negative one, and it is categorised as a binary classification problem(0 or 1). 0 stands for negative sentiment, 1 stands for positive sentiment. 

## Given Scenario
In a recent market research by IBM, almost one-third of IT professionals surveyed globally say their business is using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The survey reported almost half of businesses today are now using applications powered by natural language processing (NLP).NLP, specifically 'Sentiment Analysis', can provide a key business advantage by abstracting from unstructured text data the negative or positive attitude of the writer/author. This crucuial insight can help turn web data into market intelligence for the business.A request has been received from the web development department to add 'Sentiment Analysis' feature to a movie reviews page.
The insights from the sentiment analysis will be used to promote more popular movies.In this project, you are tasked to create a prototype NLP project that is capable of 'Sentiment Analysis' from movie reviews.
